# STEVE (Somewhat Trivially Enhanced Visual Effects)
An Iris shader pack I'm making to improve Minecraft's look subtly.

To keep things simple, I'll be supporting external PBR first, and will look at integrated PBR calculation later.

## Goals
1. Performance (sufficient to use on an iGPU at ~50 fps)
2. Readability (I want this to be an example of how to handle PBR.)
